Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a cats vs dogs tic tac toe game, which uses images of a cat and dog to
represent the Xs and Os, respectively. The following components were used to
build the game: HTML, JavaScript, CSS (with Grid and Flex layouts), Bootstrap,
and JQuery. I also utilized purchased graphics that I modified for use in the
game.

Functionalities of the game include alerts that show whose turn it is, an
ever-present button allowing a game restart, a hover image that shows before
players place their tile, and a message that overlays the main screen when one
player has won or there is a tie.
